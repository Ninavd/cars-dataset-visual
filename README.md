# Visualisation of 7-dimensional cars dataset
This repository contains code for an interactive 3D-scatter plot visualising the dataset `cars.csv`.
To access the interactive plot, please clone the repository and run all cells in the notebook or run 

```bash
python visualize.py
```
Both should work, but in my experience the pop up after running the python script reacts **much** faster than the embedded plot in the notebook.

### Expected package versions
```
matplotlib==3.9.2
ipympl==0.9.4
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4
```
